Overview
This project implements a hash table data structure to store and manage course information for a university computer science program. The hash table provides efficient insertion, search, and retrieval operations for course data loaded from a CSV file.

Features
Hash Table with Chaining: Handles collisions using linked list chaining

Course Management:

Load course data from CSV files

Validate course prerequisites

Search for courses by number

Display course information and prerequisites

Efficient Operations:

Average O(1) time complexity for insertions and searches

O(n) time complexity for printing all courses
